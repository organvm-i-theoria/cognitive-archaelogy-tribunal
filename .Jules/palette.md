## 2024-05-22 - Empty State Pattern
**Learning:** CLI tools often greet new users with a cold error message ("error: no arguments provided"). A dedicated "Empty State" that acts as a welcome screen significantly improves approachability and discoverability.
**Action:** When no arguments are provided to a CLI, display a styled welcome panel with usage examples instead of an error code.
