Excavating scattered digital artifacts (files, repos, conversations)\n2. Classifying and cataloging findings\n3. Building knowledge graphs of relationships\n4. Extracting patterns and insights\n5. Creating actionable triage reports\n\nThe goal is transforming chaos into organized, searchable knowledge systems."

Review:\n   - Check output/ for JSON results\n   - Read triage_report.txt for recommendations\n\nEverything is processed locally and can be committed for public archival."
