## 2025-02-18 - CLI Empty State UX
**Learning:** CLI tools that error out when run without arguments provide a hostile user experience. Users often run the command just to see what happens or how to use it.
**Action:** Always implement a friendly "Empty State" that guides the user on how to use the tool, rather than showing an error message. Use rich text formatting if possible to make it welcoming.
