### MARKDOWN

*   **MD040/fenced-code-language**: Fenced code blocks should have a language specified

    *   For directory structures, use `text`, `bash`, or `plaintext`.
    *   Common language identifiers for documentation:
        *   `bash` or `shell` - shell commands, file trees
        *   `python` - Python code
        *   `json` - JSON data
        *   `yaml` - YAML configuration
        *   `text` or `plaintext` - unformatted text
        *   `markdown` - nested markdown examples

### PYTHON

*   Unused imports should be removed.

## GIT RULES

*   **.gitignore**: Add `.history` to keep it out of version control (it's local file history).
*   **.gitignore**: Keep `.trunk` ignored (already covered by trunk-specific patterns, but should be explicit).
*   Configuration folders (`.vscode`, `.trunk`, `.venv`, `.github`, `.specstory`, `.history`) must stay at the workspace root where tools expect them. Attempts to consolidate them into a single directory will break their expected paths. A viable workaround is to:
    1.  Keep folders in root
    2.  Use VS Code settings to hide them from view
    3.  Let tools regenerate what they need at root (but gitignore them)

## VS CODE SETTINGS

*   To restore a hidden folder in VS Code:

    1.  Using Command Palette (⇧⌘P)
        *   Press `Cmd+Shift+P`
        *   Type "Files: Exclude"
        *   Select "Preferences: Open User Settings"
        *   Search for `files.exclude`
        *   Remove or uncheck the pattern for the folder you want to restore
    2.  Using Settings UI
        *   `Cmd+,` to open Settings
        *   Search for "files exclude"
        *   Look for the hidden folder pattern (e.g., `**/.venv` or `**/node_modules`)
        *   Click the X to remove it
    3.  Using Workspace Settings
        *   If the folder is hidden at workspace level:
        *   Open `settings.json` in your project
        *   Look for `files.exclude` configuration
        *   Remove the folder pattern
    4.  Show All Files Temporarily
        *   In the Explorer sidebar, click the "..." menu
        *   Look for filter options or "Show Excluded Files"
*   Folders typically hidden by default:

    *   `.venv` or `venv/` (Python virtual environments)
    *   `node_modules/` (Node.js dependencies)
    *   `.git/` (Git repository)
    *   `__pycache__/`
    *   `.pytest_cache/`
    *   `.trunk/` (Trunk configuration)
*   To hide folders from view in VS Code:

    1.  Keep folders in root
    2.  Use VS Code settings to hide them from view
    3.  Let tools regenerate what they need at root (but gitignore them)
