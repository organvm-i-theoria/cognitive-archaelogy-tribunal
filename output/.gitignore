# Output Directory - Public Archival Configuration
#
# This directory can contain public research data for academic expansion.
# By default, we keep outputs tracked for public consumption.
#
# To make specific outputs private, add them here.

# Logs only
*.log

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak

# If you want to keep ALL outputs private, uncomment:
# *
# !.gitignore
# !README.md
